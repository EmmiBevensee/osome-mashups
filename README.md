# OSoMe Mashups

This repository contains [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) (formerly IPython) notebooks demonstrating use of OSoMe's API in conjunction with other APIs.

By clicking on one of these `.ipynb` files, you can view the workflow and an example use case. If you have Jupyter and IPython installed on your machine, you can download, edit, and run these examples yourself. If you don't have Jupyter and IPython, we recommend installing the [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) Python distribution.

These examples are provided as-is and we cannot provide support, but please let us know if you find an error -- either tweet [@TruthyAtIndiana](https://twitter.com/TruthyAtIndiana) or submit a pull request.
